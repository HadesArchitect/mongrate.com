content_title: Bring testing and TDD to your MongoDB migrations
---

The aims of Mongrate are:

* To be an effective tool for writing MongoDB migrations.
* To enable testing and TDD while writing migrations, through YAML files.
* To be non-linear, so migrations can be applied in any order and at any time.
* To integrate with various frameworks via middleware.

To get started, check out [the documentation](docs).
